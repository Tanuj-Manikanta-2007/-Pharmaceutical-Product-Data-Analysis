📘 Pharmaceutical Product Data Analysis
This project explores pricing behavior and product patterns within the pharmaceutical domain using a large dataset of Indian medicines 💊📊. The analysis investigates how factors such as form type, pack size, manufacturer, and drug composition influence overall pricing. These insights help support better decision-making in pharmaceutical retail, competitive pricing, and market understanding.

The original dataset contained over 257,000 rows, but due to GitHub’s upload size limit, a trimmed version (indian_medicine_data_24.5mb.csv) with approximately 200,000+ rows is included here 📂. Even though the file is reduced, it preserves all essential fields—price, manufacturer, medicine type, pack size, and composition—making it fully suitable for meaningful data analysis.

All cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis steps are implemented inside G36_EDA_Pharma.ipynb 🧪. The notebook covers missing value handling, IQR-based outlier removal, univariate and bivariate visualizations, and a correlation heatmap. It highlights strong pricing patterns across tablets, syrups, creams, suspensions, and injections, as well as variation across different manufacturers and dosage strengths.

A detailed summary of insights is presented in Pharma_Report.pdf 📄✨. The report discusses key findings such as the dominance of low-cost generic tablets, the high price range of critical-care injections, form-wise and pack-size-wise pricing behavior, and the top least and most expensive medicines.

Together, the dataset, analysis notebook, and PDF report create a complete workflow—from raw data to refined insights 🚀📈. This project provides a robust foundation for pharmaceutical pricing analysis, market comparison, and potential future extensions such as clustering, prediction models, or advanced segmentation.
